# Figures

This folder contains figures from the analysis scripts in this repository. The main script to generate figures is [`figures.R`](../figures.R).

The final figures are in the root of this folder, while intermediate figures from different versioned subfolders, e.g., `v0/`, are also included.

The key figures used in the manuscript are: 

| Figure File Name | Description |
|----|----|
| `fig1_ammonia_prod.png` | Global ammonia production projections |
| `fig2_etc.png` | etc |
